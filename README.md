Using BFS to find the distances between all of the vertices with their respective edges. After finding all the distances, average the distances to have one average distance for each vertex. With those average vertices, compare pairs of those vertices to find the average distance between and pairs as well as their common neighbors. Below is a graph created of my findings.
